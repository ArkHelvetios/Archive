    p.intro__description I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a&nbsp;freelance front&#8209;end developer now, but before that I worked as a UI/UX designer with "#[span.text-accent turnkey website]" service. This means that I created website from UX-prototype to ready&#8209;to&#8209;use product.

          p.intro__description I used #[a.link-external(rel='nofollow', href='https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html/') Adobe] XD, Illustrator, Photoshop and then also #[a.link-external(rel='nofollow', href='https://www.figma.com/') Figma] for creating adaptive design.
          p.intro__description Then I was moving to some of zero&#8209;code tools - in most cases it was #[a.link-external(rel='nofollow', href='https://webflow.com/') Webflow], less often Wix, Tilda, Pinegrow and Elementor.
          p.intro__description When source was ready to import, I was going to prepare server-side and DNS settings - domain, hosting, SSL, set some #[a.link-external(rel='nofollow', href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types') DNS records] for services and #[a.link-external(rel='nofollow', href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record') wildcard] options.
          p.intro__description After that I was exporting sources to client's hosting or sometimes, if it made sense, I implement front to CMS like #[a.link-external(rel='nofollow', href='https://wordpress.org/') WordPress] or #[a.link-external(rel='nofollow', href='https://www.1c-bitrix.ru/') Bitrix]. Yeah, that's kinda my PHP back&#8209;end experience.
          p.intro__description And finally, I've set up analytical services and custom events for them - #[a.link-external(rel='nofollow', href='https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/') Google] Tag Manager, Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Social media Pixels (like #[a.link-external(rel='nofollow', href='https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel') Facebook Pixel]), and all above Russian local analogs (Yandex, VK etc).
    p.intro__description In the list below you can find my works for the period 2018-2022, which I tried to save. Unfortunately, only ~50% of them are here, because some of them are under some sort of NDA, and some of them just lost.
